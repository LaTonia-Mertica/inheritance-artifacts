# **INHERITANCE DOT ARTIFACTS**

###### _**note:** upon arrival, the inheritance site/app appears broken. it is not. view it as a blank canvas on which you can author creative, unique outcomes for a session. .. unless and until we are able to dedicate time and energy needed to operate inheritance full time, the site/app is designed for single-session use - meaning you can visit the deploy, build out the content, and be the sole or shared author as long as the session continues. once done, the inheritance site resets_

**USE VENV TO CREATE & RUN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS:**<br>

1. Execute VENV Command to Create<br>
   1a. Mac aka BASH/ZSH Users run _`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`_<br>
   1b. PC aka Windows Users run _`c:\>c:\Python35\python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv`_<br>
   **note:** basically you want to run `python3 -m venv django-env` while replacing _django-env_ appropriately

2. Execute Activate Command<br>
   2a. MAC aka BASH/ZSH Users run _`source django-env/bin/activate`_<br>
   2b. PC aka Windows Users run _`django-env\Scripts\activate.bat`_ and if it doesn't work run _`django-env\Scripts\activate.ps1`_

3. Execute Run Server Command<br>
   3a. Mac aka BASH/ZSH **and** PC aka Windows Users run _`python`_ _`manage.py`_ _`runserver`_ from app level - which is the same level within the project that contains the `manage.py` file/utility to start Django server (more info below in the run django application instructions)

**USE PIP TO INSTALL PROJECT DEPENDENCIES:**<br>

1. if installing after cloning a repo, run _`pip install -r requirements.txt`_ to execute the command to read the requirements file and install everything in it

2. if pip is already installed and want to install a package, run _`pip install [insertpackagenamehere]`_<br>
   2a. next run _`pip freeze > requirements.txt`_<br>
   2b. this command creates a file called _requirements.txt_ while populating the file with dependencies resulting from the install command in step 1 above. from the command line aka terminal run _`cat requirements.txt`_ to view dependencies listed in the file

**note:** pip is the standard package manager for python. [visit python package index to learn more about packages](https://pypi.org/). the command _`pip install`_ must be followed by the package you want to install. the command can be run to install the package with or without its dependencies

<br>

**RUN A DJANGO APPLICATION:**<br>

1. You must use the `manage.py` file/utility to run the server. From the command line/terminal `cd` to the level where the `manage.py` file/utility lives. Run the command _`python`_ _`manage.py`_ _`runserver`_. You will know the command was successful when you see the following message (or something similar):

"Watching for file changes with StatReloader

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
You have 17 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python `manage.py` migrate' to apply them.

<br>

**note:** the above message means the django application is running, you must visit the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` link to access the django application in browser. [the django welcome/homepage](images/django-welcome-homepage.png) may look like an error or exception. this is until you read what it says and follow the instructions to add url endpoints per your project into the browser. for example, `http://127.0.0.1:8000`/(insert your url endpoint here without including the parentheses).

### **HOW INHERITANCE DOT ARTIFACTS WORKS**

#### <p style="text-align: left">_visit the pages, maybe even add your own artifact to the inheritance community - just please embrace the concept_</p>

---

<br>

<img src="images/landing_page.jpg" title="Landing Page" alt="Landing Page Screen"/>

Landing Page establishes overall ambiance and navigation. It also, through SYMBOLIC RELEASE, demonstrates our elevated dedication to self-awareness, getting beyond barriers, and holistic health.
<br>
<br>

<img src="images/our_story.jpg" title="Our Story Page" alt="Our Story Page Screen"/>

Our Story shares insight, intent, and sense of community at the heart of the creation of Inheritance.
<br>
<br>

<img src="images/add_artifact.jpg" title="Add Artifacts Page" alt="Add Artifacts Page Screen"/>

Add Artifact is the opportunity to consider what you will add to the story. In other words, what image and description you would submit as an artifact.
<br>
<br>

<img src="images/gallery.jpg" title="Gallery Page" alt="Gallery Page Screen"/>

Gallery is a collection of the vibrancy of contributions through shared artifacts.
<br>
<br>
**NEXT STEPS**

- fluid interlocking image design on gallery page per image sizes
- maintain db content on re/new deploy (not delete on new deploy)
- refactor code to [more efficiently handle dynamic randomized images](https://medium.com/@jerinisready/how-to-fetch-random-item-from-a-filtered-queryset-in-django-orm-ca680df69328)
- revisit backlog and prioritize series of subsequent implementations
- purchase and implement domain for polished custom url experience
- upgrade [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) account to basic paid to maintain active server
